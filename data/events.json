I have decided the time has come for me to step down as executive director of Hilma’s Network and I have also relinquished my Liberal party membership. Due to recent events I have decided there are other ways I can support women and Australia. A reset on immigration is profoundly important.

But I think all Australians know if you come here, coming to Australia, living in Australia is one of the greatest gifts that could ever be given to anybody.
