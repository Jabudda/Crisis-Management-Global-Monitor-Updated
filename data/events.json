As someone who has spent decades working toward a just resolution between Israelis and Palestinians, including negotiating with Hamas for the release of hostages, he's watched with growing alarm the shift in Israel’s governance of the occupied territories. From his perspective, what we are witnessing is not the continuation of a temporary occupation, but the deepening of a permanent one.",

He has told Channel Nine’s Today program that police were “put in an impossible situation last night”: It’s worth remembering they did everything possible to avoid that confrontation, starting last week when they begged protest organisers to have it in Hyde Park, where it was safe and a march could take place.

The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily, a newspaper known for critical reports against both the Hong Kong and Beijing governments, was sentenced to 20 years in prison Monday for his conviction under a China-imposed national security law. Here are 10 key moments in Lai’s life showing his evolution from a clothing businessman to one of the city’s best-known pro-democracy activists. 1989: Tiananmen shifts path of clothing chain founder From a child laborer in a glove factory, Lai transformed himself into a clothing entrepreneur, founding the Giordano casual clothing chain in 1981. But the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing changes Lai’s path. Giordano prints T-shirts in support of the...",
