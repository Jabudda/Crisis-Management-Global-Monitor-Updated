President Herzog will also attend and address major communal events together with the leaders of the Australian Jewish community. A central part of the visit will be dedicated to official meetings with senior Australian leaders, including the Governor-General and the Prime Minister of Australia, as well as with leaders from across the political spectrum. President Herzog will also conduct interviews with the media during the visit. That’s a really distorted figure. And why I say that is that figure comes across 150 electorates from around the country. And as Nationals, we only stand in about 20 to 30 seats. So we don’t run in any city seats. [In] a lot of cities, we wouldn’t poll at all. We’d poll zero in Wentworth. We’d poll zero in Kooyong. We’d poll zero in Perth because we don’t stand candidates there. One Nation aren’t a regional party. I mean, One Nation are running across every seat across the whole country. So I mean it’s not even comparable in that sense. But you know obviously their figures have gone up very much since post-Bondi, and that has to be noted. Continue reading...",

Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty in March 2020 to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and a terrorism charge, after initially saying he would defend the charges.

The crisis follows the release of the Epstein Files. While Starmer is not implicated, controversy surrounds his choice of US ambassador, Peter Mandelson, who resigned last September over leaked emails linking him to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and now faces a criminal investigation, which he denies. Questions over Starmer’s judgement have intensified, with his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, resigning and taking responsibility for the appointment. France 24’s Gavin Lee is joined by James Lyons, former Director of Downing Street Communications under Keir Starmer (2024–2025).",
