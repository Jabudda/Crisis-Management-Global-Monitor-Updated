Behind this phenomenon is an unprecedented tightening of migration policy, after years of openness under former prime minister Justin Trudeau. As a result, the number of foreign students and temporary workers has plummeted in order to \"reduce pressure on housing, public services and infrastructure\", according to authorities.",
