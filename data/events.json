      "description": "Another night of demonstrations in Sydney after criticism of police actions at Monday’s protest. Follow updates live Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has defended the government’s invitation to Isaac Herzog , and said he should be “respected as a guest” while he visits. Speaking to ABC RN Breakfast this morning, Turnbull said protesters should have demonstrated “peacefully” and heeded the advice of police. But he added that in hindsight, the police should have allowed men who were praying on the street to finish. The men were captured on film being dragged on the ground by officers. Nobody is justified in assaulting police and they should have complied with the lawful directions from the police. I don’t know the whole context, but one would have hoped that the police would have waited for the prayers to be concluded, frankly … I think in retrospect, I’m sure they feel they would have been better off letting them conclude their prayers. I think the question people will ask after this visit is whether the visit from President Herzog has assisted in making it very clear that the Jewish community in Australia should not be targets of or the objects of protests against the state of Israel. I mean, the one thing we have to be clear about in this multicultural society of ours is that we cannot allow foreign wars to be fought out here. The police need to come out with a public apology. There needs to be an investigation. There are some red lines and that was crossed last night. That is simply unacceptable, and the police force should know better.... there is no excuse.
