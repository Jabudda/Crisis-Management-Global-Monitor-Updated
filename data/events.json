Hilma’s Network was formed by Mortlock to bring “Liberal-minded” women together and push the party to preselect more women. Mortlock has been a vocal advocate for modernisation in the Liberal party, including pushing for the party to support net zero targets, and was part of a small team who designed a plan for gender quotas in New South Wales preselections. I have decided the time has come for me to step down as executive director of Hilma’s Network and I have also relinquished my Liberal party membership. Due to recent events I have decided there are other ways I can support women and Australia. A reset on immigration is profoundly important. We want to see a lower number of people come to our country, but we also want to raise the standards. What that looks like, I won’t get into the details today. But I think all Australians know if you come here, coming to Australia, living in Australia is one of the greatest gifts that could ever be given to anybody. Which is why we want to make sure the people who do come here share our beliefs, share our respect for the rule of law and for democracy. Continue reading...",
